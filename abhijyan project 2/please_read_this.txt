reference (how to use new lib [requred])to some libraries like nltk 
stopwords and data is runned after importing nltk lib in python
and coming to the path i took the data set pasted it on my desktop 
 and gave the path desktop

understanded it and then
 went on my way to code the project on jupyter note book
